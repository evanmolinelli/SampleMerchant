Unfortunately, I spent too much time understanding and implementing Angular 7 into this project in which I wasn't able to implement the time-bounded restrictions for offers in my solution. If I had used just regular AJAX, it would have been more coding but would've taken less time and if I had to implement the time-bounded restrictions on offers I was looking at the Java.Timer library to incorporate that in some REST API's in order to be able to delete offers when the time limit has exceeded.
